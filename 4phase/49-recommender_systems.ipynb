Two points near one another in feature space will correspond to vectors that nearly overlap, i.e. vectors that describe a small angle $\\theta$.

    "Imagine factoring this matrix into a user matrix $P$ and an item matrix $Q^T$: $R = PQ^T$. What would the shapes of $P$ and $Q^T$ be? Clearly $P$ must have as many rows as $R$, which is just the number of users who have given ratings. Similarly, $Q^T$ must have as many columns as $R$, which is just the number of items that have received ratings. We also know that the number of columns of $P$ must match the number of rows of $Q^T$ for the factorization to be possible, but this number could really be anything. In practice this will be a small number, and for reasons that will emerge shortly let's refer to these dimensions as **latent features** of the items in $R$. If $p$ is a row of $P$, i.e. a user-vector, and $q$ is a column of $Q^T$, i.e. an item-vector, then $p$ will record the user's particular weights or *preferences* with respect to the latent features, while $q$ will record how the item ranks with respect to those same latent features. This in turn means that we could predict a user's ranking of a particular item simply by calculating the dot-product of $p$ and $q$! \n",

Here we can actually use matrix factorization to mathematically reduce the dimensionality of our original 'all users by all items' matrix into something much smaller that represents 'all items by some taste dimensions' and 'all users by some taste dimensions'. These dimensions are called ***latent or hidden features*** and we learn them from our data\" ([Medium article: \"ALS Implicit Collaborative Filtering\"](https://medium.com/radon-dev/als-implicit-collaborative-filtering-5ed653ba39fe))."
